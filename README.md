Webix Jet Demo App
===================

### How to run

- run ```npm install```
- run ```npm build```

This is just a proof of concept.
All desired views must be changed in the export_views.js file

the configuration is minimal for typescript code

Still to be solved, the dynamic loading of locales (I think on the same principle)

You can add plugins to the configuration if you need to use sass less or other. it's very simple


#### Build production files

```
npm run build
```

After that you can copy the "codebase" folder to the production server
